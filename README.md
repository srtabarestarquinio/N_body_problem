# N_body_problem - Assingment 1
This assignment tests your knowledge of Lists by requiring that you generate a model for the movement of celestial bodies in 2-dimensions.

Background:
  The n -body problem is the problem of taking the initial positions and velocities of “ n ” celestial bodies
  and predicting their subsequent positions and motions using Newtonian laws of motion and gravity.
  Where “ n ” is greater than 2, no closed-form solution exists to this problem, so a simulation (or
  something similar) is required to predict the precise positions of the celestial bodies in question.
  
Requirements:
  Your implementation must read the data file containing the details of several celestial bodies and
  simulate the motion and effects of gravity on the bodies. Your implementation must use two different
  implementations of the List data structure. Individual requirements for your implementation are detailed
  below.
  -Requirement 1: Read the data file
  -Requirement 2: Create, instantiate and maintain a List of celestial bodies
  -Requirement 3: Render each celestial body
  -Requirement 4: Change the position of the bodies
